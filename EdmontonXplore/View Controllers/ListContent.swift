    let detailsAP:[String] = ["Canada's West Edmonton Mall is not only the country's largest shopping center-and one of the largest in the world-it's also a major tourist attraction. In addition to hundreds of shops and restaurants, the facility contains a hotel, movie theaters, an ice rink, an aquarium, and much more.Adding to the appeal are the themed sections of the mall, designed to mimic the feel of popular travel destinations around the world. In Europa Boulevard, for example, many of the shops have European-style fronts and carry the names of international fashion designers, while Bourbon Street, a copy of the famous New Orleans street, is the place to visit for Creole food and live music.The mall's Galaxyland is one of the largest covered, indoor amusement parks in the world, boasting a variety of family-friendly rides, including a triple-loop roller coaster. Also fun is the recently renovated World Waterpark, the largest such attraction in North America. Highlights include the world's biggest indoor wave pool, and two 83-foot-tall (and very steep) water slides. The park, in fact, has a variety of slides, ranging from beginner to extreme.Address: 8882 - 170 Street NW, Edmonton, Alberta",
        "   The Royal Alberta Museum moved to its new location in 2018, and is now western Canada's largest museum. Home to a fascinating mix of permanent cultural and natural history exhibits, as well as always-changing temporary installations, a visit to this ultra-modern facility is certainly time well spent. Particularly impressive are the many fossils from the dinosaur and ice age eras, a large aquaria of native fish, and live insects-including some exotic and enormous species.New additions include a large feature gallery hosting traveling exhibits from across Canada and around the world, a huge new kids' gallery, and a bigger bug room with live invertebrates and a visible nursery. The museum's cultural history departments explore aboriginal cultures with artifacts from Blackfoot, Cree, and other First Nations. A well-stocked gift shop and a caf√© are also located on-site.Address: 9810 103a Ave NW, Edmonton, Alberta",
            "This national park is just a 30-minute drive from Edmonton and covers a wooded area with lakes and wetlands, and is home to all kinds of wildlife, including moose, elk, deer, and beaver. But the main attraction of Elk Island National Park is the large herd of buffalo (bison), which graze over a special enclosure.Anyone driving slowly along the road through the park cannot fail to catch sight of one of these massive shaggy beasts. Fun things to do here in the summer include hiking and biking, kayaking and canoeing, as well as camping, while winter activities include snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.The Beaver Hills area has now been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and includes a dark sky preserve, a bird sanctuary, and a wilderness center. Originally the tribal home of the Sarcee Indians, it was the Cree, however, that hunted the beaver and buffalo for their pelts, which were then traded with the large fur-trading companies.With hunting and settlement, the buffalo were almost wiped out, though some Beaver Hills buffalo are thought to have been captured in 1909 and placed in a reserve of their own. These are the forebears of the animals now living in Elk Island National Park. Address: 54401 Range Road 203, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta",
            "Established in the 1970s along the Yellowhead Highway, this open-air museum preserves the cultural heritage of the many immigrants from Bukovina and Ukraine who settled in what is now Alberta in the 1890s. Known locally simply as the Village, various historic buildings have been reconstructed on the site, and the pale onion dome of a Ukrainian church is visible from afar.There are many living history elements to explore, including a blacksmith, market, and an old-fashioned general store. Part of the fun is the opportunity to interact with the costumed guides, here to explain what life was like for these early settlers. If possible, try to time your visit with one of the many events or workshops hosted throughout the year, from cooking demonstrations to harvest celebrations and a commemoration of Ukraine's national day.Address: Hwy 16 E, Tofield, Alberta",
                              "Another open-air museum that should be included in your Edmonton travel itinerary, Fort Edmonton Park has old buildings faithfully reconstructed to reflect Edmonton's historical development. The buildings include a typical 1846 fort belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, a street from a pioneer town of 1885, the up-and-coming provincial capital in 1905, as well as buildings from the 1920s.

Visitors who plan to be in Edmonton during the festival should be sure to book accommodation well in advance.its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation.

While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects."]
